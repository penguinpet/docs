title: Computed Columns
summary: A computed column stores data generated by an expression included in the column definition.
toc: false

A computed column stores data generated from other columns by an [expression](sql-expressions.html) included in the column definition. Computed columns can either be `STORED` or `VIRTUAL`.

<div id="toc"></div>

## How do computed columns work?



## Considerations

Computed columns:

- Cannot be added once a table is created.
- Cannot reference other computer columns.
- Behave like any other column, with the exception that they cannot be written to directly.


## Creation

Computed columns can only be added at the time of [table creation](create-table.html). Use the following syntax:

~~~
column_name <type> AS <expr> [ STORED | VIRTUAL]
~~~

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
`column_name` | The [name/identifier](keywords-and-identifiers.html#identifiers) of the computed column.
`type` | The [data type](data-types.html) of the computed column.
`expr` | The [function](functions-and-operators.html) of the non-computed columns in the table.
`STORED` | _(Default)_ The computed column is stored alongside other columns. This is required if the column appears in the [Primary Key](primary-key,html).
`VIRTUAL` | The computed column is only computed when read.
